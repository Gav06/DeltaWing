# DeltaWing
DeltaWing is (eventually) a game written in C, using OpenGL and CGLM compiled for Windows and Linux using GCC/MinGW and CMake

## Idea
I plan for the game to be a 2D sidescrolling airplane shooter, with gameplay inspired by the old flash game (awesome planes)[https://archive.org/details/awesomeplanes_flash].
Possibly retro-style vector graphics, and post-processing to look like an old CRT, similar to (Superhot's menu)[https://interfaceingame.com/screenshots/superhot-main-menu/], but over the game.
