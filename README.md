# DeltaWing
DeltaWing is (eventually) a game written in C, using [GLAD](https://glad.dav1d.de/) to load OpenGL, [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) to manage windows, the [stb_image.h](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.h) header for image loading, and [CGLM](https://github.com/recp/cglm) (C port of GLM) for math utilities. This is compiled for Windows and Linux using GCC/MinGW and CMake. This project is mainly for me to learn C and the ins and outs of modern OpenGL.

## Idea
Idea for a 2D airplane type of game came from [Awesome Planes](https://archive.org/details/awesomeplanes_flash), although this may ultimately end up as a flappy bird clone lol.
\*Possibly\* retro-style vector graphics, and post-processing to look like an old CRT, similar to [Superhot's menu](https://interfaceingame.com/screenshots/superhot-main-menu/), but over the game maybe.
